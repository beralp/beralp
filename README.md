- 👋 Hi, I’m **@beralp**. You can call me **Berkay** ;)
- 👀 I’m interested in **QA** and **web technologies**. I am this dude who comes to the bar and orders -5 beers.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **Selenium** (using python). I know **Cypress** good enough to write tests, but to be better I am learning Cypress too :)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything! Can be any **open source** project, can be testing any **app** or **game** (did I say that I used to be a game tester?) 
- 📫 How to reach me **ber.alp@outlook.com**
